      and future facing game development studio looking to bridge the gap between 
      the fintech and gaming industries by creating a unique digital ecosystem, 
      powered by our proprietary cryptocurrency (APEX) that can be earned and 
      used across our products and services. Instead of account locked rewards 
      points or coins, our games and apps will use blockchain technology to put 
      currency directly into their crypto wallets. APEX can be redeemed for 
      in-game items, real world merchandise from our e-shop, or traded with 
      others outside of our games, thereby giving our users the power to generate 
      value outside of our platforms.
